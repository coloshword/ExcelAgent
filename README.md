- goal is to choose the AI capable of planning enough to solve the problem
- another goal is to choose A setup, one that's capable `



- goal is to make a basic agent, that can automate very easy tasks but quickly
- So we will simply use the greedy algorithm, simply we are going to create the task and run it.
